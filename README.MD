# Title

## Purpose:

This read me has two goals:

1. To describe the steps of how to host and format a resume using Markdown, VSCode, and Jekyll.
2. Relate these steps described above to the to the general principles of current Technical
   Writing, as explained in Andrew Etter's book Modern Technical Writing

## Prerequisites:

- A resume created/formatted using [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Instructions, including animated gif

- How do I create the repo ?
  -Steps to create repo:
  - Create repo with read me
  - Upload resume.md
  - Set github pages to host from docs folder
  - Run jekyll new /docs (required to create a sub directory )
  - Drag all of the contents out of the home folder and into the root folder (this is annoying but the command forces a path)
  - remove the about.md file (since this will be a single page )
  - In index.markdown, add your resume content under the "---"
  - update the config.yml to include the details you want - Site title - Github name - etc.

Use headings and numbered lists
Remember to use each step to explain
both how to follow the tools and model Etter
recommends and how to host a resume in GitHub Pages or Codeberg Pages. It's up to
you whether you 1) begin with Etter's general process and then demonstrate the
process with a practical step involving your resume, or 2) begin with the practical
steps for hosting a resume and relate each practical step to a concept in Etter's book.
Add an animated gif: Include a demo using an animated gif in your README. The gif
should feature your own resume (showing your own name).
