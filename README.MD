# How to Host a Markdown Resume with Github Pages and Jekyll

## Purpose:

This read me has two goals:

1. To describe the steps of how to host and format a resume using Markdown, VSCode, and Jekyll.
2. Relate these steps described above to the to the general principles of current Technical
   Writing, as explained in Andrew Etter's book Modern Technical Writing

## Prerequisites:

- A resume created/formatted using [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
   > Why Markdown? As described in Etter's book *Modern Technical Writing*, Markdown is the most widely used markup language in the world, and therefore is compatible with most technologies. It provides an easily formattable document for your website. 
- A Github account 
- Install VSCode
- Install [Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) using the latest Ruby + Devkit link. 
- Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), following the guide for your specific OS.

### Creating Your Repo

1. In the upper-right corner of any page on github, use the + drop-down menu, and select _New Repository_
![](https://github.com/NateG3040/NateG3040.github.io/blob/main/public/Capture.PNG)
2. Enter username.github.io as the repository name. Replace username with your GitHub username. For example, if your username is octocat, the repository name should be octocat.github.io

3. Check the "Initialize project with README checkbox.
![](https://github.com/NateG3040/NateG3040.github.io/blob/main/public/4.png)
4. Click Create Repository

### Enabling Github Pages

1. Under the repository name click **Settings**
![](https://github.com/NateG3040/NateG3040.github.io/blob/main/public/6.png)
2. On the left-side menu, find and select the _Pages_ option
3. Under _Build and deployment_ select "Deploy from branch" as your source.
4. Select "main" as the branch to deploy from, and "/docs" as the folder to build from.

5. Your site will now be hosted at "https://username.github.io/"

### Clone your repo to VSCode

1. Open the command pallet with the key combination Ctrl + shift + p
2. In the prompt, enter "gitcl", select the **Git: Clone** command, then select **clone from GitHub**
3. Select the repo to clone

4. If you are asked to sign into GitHub, complete the signin process
5. When prompted with a notification asking if you want to open the cloned repository, click **open**.

### Create a Jekyll Project

(Requires Ruby and Jekyll to be installed on machine)

>Why do we use Jekyll? As described in Etter's book, there are many other static site generators, Jekyll is just the most popular. The advantage of a static site generator is that it allows us to worry about the contents of our documentation (or in this case resume), rather than the underlying code to style it. 
1. In your cloned repository, open the terminal and enter the command "jekyll new /docs". This will create a new jekyll projects under a new /docs folder in your repo.
2. When the command terminates, you should have a new folder called "docs" containing files generated by jekyll.

### Configuring your Jekyll Project

Since we want this to be a single page website, there is no need to setup additional pages containing your resume. Instead we will replace the content of the jekyll generated home page.

1. Find and open the index.markdown file in your repository in vscode.
2. Paste your markdown formatted resume contents under the bottom " --- " of this file.

```
---
layout: default
---
//Your MD resume content here 
```

3. Delete the auto generated "pages" folder and its content
4. Delete the auto generated about.MD file
5. Open the \_config.yml file and edit the contents of

```
title: //title for you page 
email: //Email to display 
description: //Description for bottom right of site 
github_username: //Github username to display 
```
>Note: I would recommend deleting the contents of description. This follows Etter's concept of only writing necessary information and avoiding bloat. Your resume should speak for itself, the contents of a description unless vital, will likely be redundant and uneccesary. 

6. Delete the line containing twitter name unless you want to link your twitter
7. Do not adjust the URL or baseURL options

### Push your changes to your repo

1. In VSCode, select the source control tab on the left-hand menu
2. Click the + button beside changes to stage all of your changes

3. Write a descriptive commit message in the "message" input
>Why do we need to write commit messages? As per Etter's book, we should be continuously itterating our projects/documentation. Writing descriptive commit messages allows us to easily find when/where specific things were changed in case they need to be reverted at any point. 
4. Click the commit button
5. Click the new "Sync Changes" button that replaces the commit button
6. When prompted with "THis will push/pull commits" to your main branch, select "ok"
7. Your changes are now pushed to your repo and will reflect on your website withing 10 seconds to 2 minutes.

## FAQ

- Why is Markdown better than a word processor?
  - As discussed in Etters book under *Use LightWeight Markup*, Markup has many advantages. Markup provides the advantage of providing an easily formatted document for web pages, compared to writing XML code. The advantage of Markup + Jekyll, is the ability to completely redesign and reformat your markdown file without changing the contents using Jekyll themes. 
- I am receiving the error *"Jekyll: Command not found"* when running *"Jekyll new /doc"*
   - This is due to your terminal not knowing the jekyll command. If you have not already installed jekyll, please do so by following [this guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). 
   - If you have already installed Jekyll, try restarting your VSCode.
