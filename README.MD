# How to Host a Markdown Resume with Github Pages and Jekyll

## Purpose:

This read me has two goals:

1. To describe the steps of how to host and format a resume using Markdown, VSCode, and Jekyll.
2. Relate these steps described above to the to the general principles of current Technical
   Writing, as explained in Andrew Etter's book Modern Technical Writing

## Prerequisites:

- A resume created/formatted using [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
- VSCode
- Ruby
- A Device with your github credential set up on it

### Clone your repo to VSCode

2. In the prompt, enter "gitcl", select the **Git: Clone** command, then select **clone from GitHub**

4. If you are asked to sign into GitHub, complete the signin process
5. When prompted with a notification asking if you want to open the cloned repository, click **open**.

### Create a Jekyll Project

(Requires Ruby and Jekyll to be installed on machine)

1. In your cloned repository, open the terminal and enter the command "jekyll new /docs". This will create a new jekyll projects under a new /docs folder in your repo.
2. When the command terminates, you should have a new folder called "docs" containing files generated by jekyll.

### Configuring your Jekyll Project

Since we want this to be a single page website, there is no need to setup additional pages containing your resume. Instead we will replace the content of the jekyll generated home page.

1. Find and open the index.markdown file in your repository in vscode.
2. Paste your markdown formatted resume contents under the bottom " --- " of this file.

```
---
layout: default
---
```

3. Delete the auto generated "pages" folder and its content
4. Delete the auto generated about.MD file
5. Open the \_config.yml file and edit the contents of

```
title:
email:
description:
github_username:
```

6. Delete the line containing twitter name unless you want to link your twitter
7. Do not adjust the URL or baseURL options

### Push your changes to your repo

1. In VSCode, select the source control tab on the left-hand menu
2. Click the + button beside changes to stage all of your changes

3. Write a descriptive commit message in the "message" input
4. Click the commit button
5. Click the new "Sync Changes" button that replaces the commit button
6. When prompted with "THis will push/pull commits" to your main branch, select "ok"
7. Your changes are now pushed to your repo and will reflect on your website withing 10 seconds to 2 minutes.

## FAQ

- my page name is showing up on home page
- I dont have permissions to clone repo/ push to repo

## Notes (to remove)

- How do I create the repo ?
  -Steps to create repo:
  - Create repo with read me
  - Upload resume.md
  - Set github pages to host from docs folder
  - Run jekyll new /docs (required to create a sub directory )
  - Drag all of the contents out of the home folder and into the root folder (this is annoying but the command forces a path)
  - remove the about.md file (since this will be a single page )
  - In index.markdown, add your resume content under the "---"
  - update the config.yml to include the details you want - Site title - Github name - etc.

Use headings and numbered lists
Remember to use each step to explain
both how to follow the tools and model Etter
recommends and how to host a resume in GitHub Pages or Codeberg Pages. It's up to
you whether you 1) begin with Etter's general process and then demonstrate the
process with a practical step involving your resume, or 2) begin with the practical
steps for hosting a resume and relate each practical step to a concept in Etter's book.
Add an animated gif: Include a demo using an animated gif in your README. The gif
should feature your own resume (showing your own name).

1. a Markdown tutorial

3. at least one other resource
